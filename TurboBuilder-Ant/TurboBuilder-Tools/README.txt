Turbo builder tools ******


This folder contains all the tools that are required by Turbo builder to perform most of its tasks and optimizations.

You must copy this folder to your machine. By default, Turbo builder looks for this folder on your operating system home directory, so the fastest
way to get started is to copy all the files to "MY_USER_HOME_DIR/TurboBuilder-Tools/". 


The default location can be changed by editing the TurboBuider.xml setup file.

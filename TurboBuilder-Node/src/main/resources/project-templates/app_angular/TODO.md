# Steps to correctly setup a new angular project

So you've generated a new angular project with turbobuilder, and there's no angular files at all. This is because angular already has a project generation tool, and we should use it. We will create the project and then perform some changes to adapt it to the turbo way of life. So, follow these steps:

1. You should have already executed tb -g app_angular (To generate this TODO file)

2. Run cmd at the root of the project:
    
    - `ng new my-project-name`
    - Follow the instructions and customize the project to your needs
        - The css format must be scss
    
3. Go into the newly generated my-project-name folder, and perform the following changes:

    - Delete .git folder, .gitignore and README.md files if exist

4. Cut all the files inside the generated my-project-name folder and paste them outside it (one level up)

    - Override the src folder that was generated by turbobuilder

5. Delete the now empty my-project-name folder
 
6. Perform the following file changes:

    - From `src/styles.scss` to `src/main/view/css/global.styles.scss`
    - From `src/app/app.module.ts to `src/main/model/modules`
    - From `src/app/app.component.* to `src/main/view/components/app`
    - Delete the now empty src/app folder

7. Run cmd at the root of the project:
    
    - `npm install turbocommons-ts`
    - `npm install turbogui-angular`
    
8. Edit the package.json file and:

    - Set a value to "description" just after name (Add the description property if it does not exist).

9. Edit the turbobuilder.json file and:

    - Set "metadata" / "name" to the same name as defined in package.json
    - Set "metadata" / "description" to the same name as defined in package.json

10. Edit the angular.json file and:
    
    - Change "outputPath" from dist/my-project-name to target/my-project-name
    - Replace the entries on "build"/"styles" with the following:
        - "src/main/view/css/normalize.css"
        - "src/main/view/css/global.styles.scss"
        
11. Edit the src/main.ts file and:

    - Fix the `import { AppModule } from './app/app.module';` path to `./main/model/modules/app.module`
            
12. Edit the src/main/model/modules/app.module.ts file and:

    - Fix the `import { AppComponent } from './app.component';` path to `../../view/components/app/app.component`

13. Delete this TODO.md file!!
